Title: Widen, Process, then Re-Tidy Data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("David", "Robinson", email = "admiral.david@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Encapsulates the pattern of un-tidying data into a wide matrix,
  performing some processing, then turning it back into a tidy form. This
  is useful for several operations such as co-occurence counts,
  correlations, or clustering that are mathematically convenient on wide matrices.
